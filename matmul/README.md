# Matrix multiplication

## Problem

Given two dense matrices of `A` and `B` of `float`s, where `A` is `m`
by `l` and `B` is `l` by `n`, compute the `m`-by-`n` product matrix`C
= A * B`, where `C[i][j]` is the sum over `k` of `A[i][k] * B[k][j]`.
The dimensions `m`, `n`, and `l` are similar but not identical.
